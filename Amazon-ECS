ECR and ECS work independently.

ECR:
ECR can be used for a separate private docker registry
ECR repository should be created for each docker image.


ECS:
ECS maintains the cluster of EC2 instances and run the task(desired state) using docker service(swarm) mode.

Setup CICD with ECS:

From AWS, we should create the cluster and define the task defintion which points to ECR repository.
Create the service and provide the task definition with desired count. You should able to access the application.
To update the service, we should explicitly update with update-service command. 
There are no triggers to update the service..like in OpenShift import-image to Image Stream updating DC..so, updating the docker image in ECR will not update the service automatically.

We should always use this:
 aws ecs update-service --service pearupweb --region eu-central-1 --cluster PearUp --desired-count 0
 aws ecs update-service --service pearupweb --region eu-central-1 --cluster PearUp --desired-count 1

Update the image in ECR, make the service desired count to 0 and update the service with original desired count.. so it will update with newly pushed image.

See Jenkinsfile2 for waituntil method to keep alive the terminal to check the updated count.
